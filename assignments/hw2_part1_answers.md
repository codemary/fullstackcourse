Homework Assignment 2

Part 1

Answer 1:

Logical errors are semantic errors. When a logical error occurs, it does not usually crash the program but rather it causes the program to behave incorrectly.
Unlike a program with syntax errors, a program with logic errors can be run, but it does not operate as intended. They are not reported by the interpreter.
Syntax errors occur in case of a typo. 

Answer 2:

The classifications of computer languages are many. Compiled versus interpreted; static versus dynamic; scripting versus non-scripting to name a few. In computer science, there is a universal truth: ultimately every computer language is translated into machine code.
Languages are either compiled from scrach or scripts are interpreted in a computer language which ultimately gets interpreted into the machine code.
As far as Python is concerned, there is an intermediate layer. Python is written in C. The scripts that are written in Python are filtered throuch C and interpreted to machine code. This makes Python an interpreted language. Python is definitely not a compiled language. 
Scripting languages are written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Python allows extensively typing it in at a shell prompt and getting answers immediately. Thus Python becomes a scripting language.
So if the question is asked whether Python is a complied language or a scripting language, the answer is scripting.
